# ESP32-Based-Patient-Monitoring-System
An IOT based working solution for Patient monitoring solution <br/>
This project is talks about ESP32 based Patient Monitoring System eliminating the errors that you might face while completing this project.<br/>


                                                  ""WRONG DHT LIBRARY""
It is a major error that you need to reslove. DHT library usually found in codes online is the one that is designed for ARDUINO Hardware giving out unnecessary errors.<br/> 
To install the right library, go to Library manager and download DHT11 library for Adafruit. After downloading the DHT11 library, it needs Adafruit unified sensors library to read, download this one too. Use the following link for reference. <br/>
